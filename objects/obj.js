// Adding objects as properties of another object should be done carefully.

// Writing x[y] = {name:”Vivek”} , is same as writing x[‘object Object’] = {name:”Vivek”} ,

// While setting a property of an object, javascript coerces the parameter into a string.

// Therefore, since y is an object, it will be converted to ‘object Object’.

// Both x[y] and x[z] are referencing the same property.
